# settings

  [![license][license-image]][license-url]

Configuration 'n' snippets.

## Motivation/goals

Keeping pretty much all settings under a single repo enables faster setups.

## Status

Permanently *in progress*.

## How does it look like?

Some highlights:
* macOS [utils and tweaks](/env-howto/macos/fresh-setup.md)
* a bunch of [dotfiles](/dotfiles/README.md)
* Sublime Text and VSCode [preferences](/code-editors/README.md)

## Resources

* [`.bashrc`](/dotfiles/.bashrc) is inspired by [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sample-bashrc.html)
* [`.tmux.conf`](/dotfiles/.tmux.conf) is partially taken from [Making tmux Pretty and Usable - A Guide to Customizing your tmux.conf](http://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf)
